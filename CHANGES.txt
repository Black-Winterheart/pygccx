0.2.0:
    - NEW FEATURES
      - New model keyword *TIE (model_keywords.Tie)
      - New model keyword *EQUATION (model_keywords.Equation)
      - New model keyword *INCLUDE (model_keywords.Include)
      - New model keyword *DEFORMATION PLASTICITY (model_keywords.DeformationPlasticity)
      - New step keyword *GREEN (step_keywords.Green) 
        Can also be used as a step keyword
      - New class model_keywords.Universal to write arbitrary strings 
        to input file
      - New method model.update_mesh_from_inp(filename, ignore_unsup_elems, clear_mesh)
        for reading mesh, sets and surfaces from ccx input file.
      - New method mesh.add_sets(*sets) 
        for adding existing ISet instances to mesh.
      - New method mesh.add_node_surface(surf_name, nids) 
        for manuel creation of node surfaces .
      - New method mesh.add_el_face_surface(surf_name, faces)
        for manuel creation of element face surfaces 
      - New method mesh.add_surfaces(*surfaces)
        for adding existing ISurface instances to mesh.
      - New parameter "no_cpu" in model.solve
        for selecting the number of cpus used during solve.
      - New parameter "load_inp" in model.show_results_in_cgx.
        Loading of the inp file together with the frd is now optional
      

    - CHANGES:
      - Removed attribute "dim" from ISet.
      - Removed class ElementFace.
        Element faces inside an IElement are now represented by nested tuples
        Each face is a tuple with the node ids forming this face
        (
          (1, 2, 3), # face 1 of element, made up from nodes 1,2,3
          (1, 3, 4), # face 2 of element, made up from nodes 1,2,4
        )
      - Changes in method mesh.add_set(set_name, set_type, ids)
        If a set with given name and set_type already exists, 
        ids are added to the existing set.
  

0.1.0: 
    - NEW FEATURES:
        - Added Keywords *NODE PRINT, *EL PRINT, *CONTACT PRINT
        - Added result reader for frd.<br>
          With model.get_frd_results() a result object is returned for querying results from frd file
        - Added result reader for dat.<br>
          With model.get_dat_results() a result object is returned for querying results from dat file
        - Added example "specimen_weibull" as a Jupyter notebook to show
          the use of model.get_dat_results()

    - CHANGES:
        - Changed name of enum ENodeResults to ENodeFileResults
        - Changed name of enum EElementResult to EElFileResults
        - Changed name of enum EContactResults to EContactFileResults
