Hello every one,

as I have written in my thread "Boolean-like parameters in ccx input keywords", I'm currently working on a python framework for building
and solving CalculiX models.
Now my project has reached a certain level and I want to make it open source under the GPL V3.

Here is the GitHub link:
https://github.com/FrozenWinterheart/pygccx_project.git

I would appreciate if anyone would like to take a look or try it out. Maybe someone would like
to contribute. There is still a lot to do:
Implementing new keywords, writing tests, writing more and/or better documentation, refactoring, 
improving usability and a lot of discussion.

To get a first impression, look at the files in the examples folder.
